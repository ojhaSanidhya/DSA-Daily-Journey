# DSA Daily Journey 🚀  

Welcome to **DSA Daily Journey**! This repository is a structured collection of my daily learning materials on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My goal is to help others by sharing the approach I used to learn DSA effectively while maintaining my GitHub contributions.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here:
- **Concepts**: Detailed explanations of DSA topics.
- **Code Implementations**: Well-structured solutions in C++ (or other languages).
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Step-by-step breakdown of problems.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Discussing different approaches and their complexities.
- **Daily Updates**: A new topic or problem uploaded daily.

## 📖 Learning Plan:
I will upload DSA topics and problems in the following order:
1. **Basics of DSA** (Arrays, Strings, Recursion, etc.)
2. **Arrays**
3. **Strings**
4. **Sorting & Searching**
5. **Linked Lists**
6. **Stacks & Queues**
7. **Trees & Graphs**
8. **Dynamic Programming**
9. **Greedy Algorithms**
10. **Advanced Topics** (Trie, Segment Tree, Bit Manipulation, etc.)

## 🎯 How This Helps:
- **Structured Learning**: Learn DSA step by step.
- **Concept Clarity**: Each topic explained with code.
- **Consistency**: Regular updates ensure continuous learning.
- **Interview Preparation**: Essential topics for coding interviews.

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- C++ (Primary Language)
- Python (Optional for some problems)
- Markdown for Documentation
